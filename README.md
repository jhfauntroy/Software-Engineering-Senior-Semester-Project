# Software-Engineering-Senior-Semester-Project
This repository includes all the files for a semester long group project I was apart of in 2019. 

The files I was responsible for specifically are the "MainMenu.java", "Calculator.java", and "Game.java" files. 

The file, "Visualizer", was done by one of my partners, and at the end, I was responsible for linking/stiching it together with the "Calculator.java" and "Game.java" files. 

The "ProjectileMotion.java" file was the back-end calculations used for the projectile motion done by a 3rd partner.
